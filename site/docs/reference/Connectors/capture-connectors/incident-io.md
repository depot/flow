# Incident.io

This connector captures data from Incident.io into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-incident-io:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-incident-io:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.
